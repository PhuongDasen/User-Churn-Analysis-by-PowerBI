## [🔍 Final Conclusion & Recommendations](#-final-conclusion--recommendations) 
<ul>
  <li>Competitors have better offers + prices than our company.</li>
  <li>Our customer service is not good, churn customers have a much higher avg customer service call rate = 2.4 than average.</li>

  <li>It is necessary to have online + phone consultants to solve the problems that customers encounter.</li>
  <li>Customers who sign up for a month to month contract need to have incentives for: top up, preferential data packages to retain this group of customers.</li>
  <li>Need to improve the unlimited data package in terms of price or create a really preferential data package for the group of customers who need to use from 0 to 10 gb monthly.</li>
  <li>Create great offers for new customers, but also have incentives and gratitude for loxal cuatomers, but customers churn because competitors are better than our company 45% of the reason for churn.</li>
</ul>
